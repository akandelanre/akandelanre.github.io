Fall 2020 is already here! Hard to believe summer "mostly" flew by given the current state of things, with most of us spending most of that time indoors (thanks covid!). I learned a ton experimenting with different tools for teaching [STA 360/602](https://sta-360-602l-su20.github.io/Course-Website/) online this summer. Excited to teach "IDS 702: Modeling and Representation of Data" once again this fall, this time online, and taking advantage of some of the tools I used over the summer. Please find the website for IDS 702 for fall 2020 [here](https://ids-702-f20.github.io/Course-Website/).

I hope the outlook on things starts to change somewhat sometime this fall. It would be really tough if things continue to look the same heading into Spring 2021. Anyway, I hope we are all able to make the best of fall 2020. Cheers!
