### R and R Markdown Resources

R Markdown can be used to create high quality reports and presentations with embedded chunks of R code. To learn more about R Markdown and for other resources for programming in R, see the links below.

1. [R for Data Science (by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
2. [Introduction to R Markdown (Article by Garrett Grolemund)](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html)
3. [Introduction to R Markdown (Slides by Andrew Cho)](http://rpubs.com/andrew-cho/303981)
4. [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
5. [Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf)
6. [Other Useful Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#import)
7. [A very (very!) basic R Markdown template](https://sta-602l-s20.github.io/Course-Website/labs/resources/LabReport.Rmd)

### LaTeX

LaTeX is another very useful tool. You may find it easier to create your TeX and LaTeX documents using online editors such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) (simply create a free account and you are good to go!). However, that need not be the case. If you prefer to create them locally/offline on your personal computers, you will need to download a TeX distribution (the most popular choices are [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) for Windows and [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS) plus an editor (I personally prefer [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org) but feel free to download any editor of your choice). Follow the links below for some options, and to also learn how to use LaTeX.

1. [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
2. [Choosing a LaTeX Compiler](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler).

### Interesting Articles

These are articles I find interesting as supplementary readings for topics covered in my courses.

1. [A Dirty Dozen: Twelve P-Value Misconceptions (by Steven Goodman)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037196308000620)
2. [American Statistical Association Statement on P-values](https://www.amstat.org//asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf)
