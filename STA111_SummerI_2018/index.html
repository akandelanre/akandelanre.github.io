			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p> Please find the syllabus here: <a href="Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> <br /><br />

Probability and statistical inference provide tools needed to answer a very broad range of interesting
questions in various fields. For example, how likely was Loyola IL to make the final four at the beginning
of the 2017/2018 season or what is the probability that you will make six or more digits annual salary
after graduation if you move to New York? This is an introductory level class that aims to provide some
of the theoretical probability and statistical inference background needed for students to go on to study
advanced quantitative analyses in the natural and social sciences, financial statistics, and so on. You
will learn the basic laws of probability, random events, independence, expectations and Bayes theorem.
You will also learn discrete and continuous random variables, density and distribution functions, point
estimation, confidence intervals, Bayesian inference, one and two-sample mean problems, simple linear
regression, multiple linear regression, and much more. While this is an introductory class with most
students being freshmen, higher level students can also take the class as a first-level theoretical refresher
course for a more advanced class or simply out of interest. All students must have some background in
calculus (see prerequisites) to be able to keep up with and understand the materials. <br /> <br />
			</p>
			<p> <strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <br />
                By the end of this class, students should be able to
				<ul>
                    <li> Define probability, random variables, probability density and mass functions, probability distribution
                        functions and use probability results for statistical inference. </li>
                    <li> Derive and verify some well-known statistical results, for example, maximum likelihood estimators
                        for common distributions.</li>
                    <li> Apply the probability results and statistical models developed in class to real data from economics,
                        public policy, social science, and so on. </li>
				<li> Summarize and analyze data using R or Stata. </li> </ul>
