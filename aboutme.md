Starting 2022, I will be pivoting and pursuing a new adventure away from academia to work as a Research Scientist at Meta. 

Between 2019 and 2021, I was an Assistant Professor of the Practice (officially an Instructor from 2019 to 2020) in the [Social Science Research Institute](https://ssri.duke.edu), and the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University.

My research areas include Bayesian modeling, models for editing erroneous data, multiple imputation, missing data, mixture models, and hierarchical modeling. My research focuses primarily on developing statistical methodology for handling missing and faulty data, with particular emphasis on applications that intersect with the social sciences. I am especially motivated to develop methods that can be readily applied by statistical agencies and data analysts.

I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke, under the supervision of [Dr Jerry Reiter](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/). Prior to that, I also completed my M.S. in Statistical and Economic modeling at Duke. Prior to coming to Duke, I worked as an analyst at KPMG Professional Services, Nigeria between 2011 and 2012, and completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Lagos, Nigeria in 2010.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing and watching soccer, reading, playing video games, listening to music, and traveling. I have also become a bit of an NBA fanatic and I intend to do some NBA-related research in the near future.
